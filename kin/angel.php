<h1>Angel</h1>
<div class="center box">
<h2>Overview</h2>
Etherically speaking, an Angel is a race of beings. This thread is about the Angels that reside in the Judeo-Christian version of Heaven (although the two are very different.)
<h2>Alternative Classifications</h2>
<h3>Fallen Angel</h3>
Fallen Angels are Angelics that have chosen to leave Heaven. Majority left during The Great Fall, and have formed their own groups and factions. One can become a fallen angel by willingly choosing so or being exiled under a rule.
<h3>Nephilim</h3>
Nephilims are the product of an Angelic and a Human relationship. During Yahweh's rule, they were hunted as abominations and thus the their population fell very rapidly. There are some still around, but not as much as they used to be.
<h3>Guardian Angel</h3>
Guardian Angels are humans trying to become Angelic. They can sometimes be appointed to others within Heaven-allied cities in the Etheric that decide to reincarnate. They cross over into the Biolocative plane to look after them.
<h2>Appearance</h2>
All angels within the second and third sphere have two wings. Affinities do play some part in the look of an angel's wings, although they are primarily white or a cream colored. Secondary affinities are displayed in some of feathers. I.E.: Water affinity would result in a blue-ish hue (no solid colors) to the wings. When injured, angel blood flows white.
<h2>Energy</h2>
In addition to light, most Angels can develop all four of the basic affinities, although most tend to lean towards fire, air and water. After a while, the four basics can sometimes start to get light energy properties from being used alongside one another.
<h3>Grace</h3>
Grace is a quality in the light energy found in Angels. It can be seen as an identifier, as you can't enter Heaven on your own (without outside help) without it. Grace amplifies the light energy, and depending on the person can help further develop an affinity of fire. If an Angel becomes fallen, and chooses to remove themselves of grace, their light energy becomes "generic" of a sorts and can no longer be comparable with an Angels regular light energy.
<h2>Lifestyle</h2>
Angels lack the need to eat because their systems are self-sustaining. Exerting energy faster than the body can replace it will result in a need of external resupply, which could lead to eating to make up for loss of energy or sleeping. The bigger the energetic system, the more energy that can be exerted without the need of a resupply. However, even though they lack the need to eat, Heaven still produces food. It is also rare to find an angel family with more than two children.
<h2>Heirarchy</h2>
<p>Here are the standard 3 sphere hierarchy and their orders;
<p>First Sphere: Seraphim, Sera-Hashmal(Hashmallim; plural) Cherubim, Cher-Hayyoth, Ophanim, Oph-Er'el(Erelim)
<p>Second Sphere: Dominion, Virtue, Power
<p>Third Sphere: ArchAngel, Principality, Angel

<h2>First Sphere</h2>

<h3>Seraphim</h3>
One of the highest ranks achievable in Heaven, Seraphim are rarely seen by the public and remain close to Vil'de El. They make up Lux Napea, a special force that work closely with YHWH. Seraphims have six wings, the appear to be lit on fire. Similar to the following picture.

<h3>Sera-Hashmal(Hashmallim)</h3>
These Angels are also considered Seraphims, but differ slightly in their energy and role. The Hashmal are smaller in numbers, and can work in tight groups similar to the Lux Napea. Energy wise they emit this sort of buzz, with the affinity of electricity and lightning. They also have six wings, but appear to be electric.

<h3>Cherubim</h3>
The Cherubim are knows as "honor guards." Not only are they tasked with protecting Vil'de El, they are also stationed around Heaven protecting valuables, and security systems. They have four wings, that are noticeably large. The wings in this picture are really close to a Cherubim's wing placement.

<h3>Cher-Hayyoth</h3>
The Hayyoth are the eyes of Heaven within. It's unlikely to meet one, but are constantly around. They are knowledgeable and keep many years and years of important records. They have four wings, that have a more airy feel to them, almost transparent like.

<h3>Ophanim</h3>
They are the eyes and ears of Heaven on the Ether floor. They can be stationed anywhere, and make sure that everything runs smoothly in Heaven-allied cities, and other factions. Ophanim's also work to keep Heaven's defense as strong as possible. They have two wings, that are long and angular.

<h2>Second Sphere</h2>

<h3>Dominion</h3>
A Dominion is a term referring to an Angel acting as a mayor. They resolve and take care of local issues that doesn't warrant the interference of the capital.

<h3>Virtues</h3>
They handle the reincarnation process, and that guardian angels are assigned to the right people.

<h3>Powers</h3>
Excluding Yahweh and the first sphere, a Power can hold high military status. Usually as generals or commanders. A Power can also be the chief of police, or an angel who directs the police force.

<h2>Third Sphere</h2>

<h3>ArchAngel</h3>
(Not to be confused with the Archangels Mikael, Zadkiel, Gabriel etc): Anybody in the military who have a unit or a group to command. They take their orders from Powers and higher ups.

<h3>Principality</h3>
They are the gathers, generally working in small groups of 2-3 to carry out missions within the Etheric or Heaven.
