<h1>Sethian/Asetian</h1>
<div class="center box">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>These two races are said to be descendant/creations Aset her older brother Set, they are from experience/gathered experience a race/bloodline of the first vampires/vampiric beings originating from the Egyptian Pantheon, and they feed on energy/life force of others. There's not much known about them, except many misconceptions throughout the web.</p>
<h2>How do they differ from Daimons?</h2>
<p>These three vampiric races differ from daimons due to the fact they do not need to consume souls, however, they do feed similar to succubus and incubus. They differ also from Daimons due to the daimons having a point on them (their chest) that is their weakness while Sethians, Asetians do not have such a thing. While Daimons reside in the Abyss, Sethians reside on Set/Sutekh's world Cyradin, Asetian's in Aset/Isis PR.</p>
<h2>Energy</h2>
Sethians have a limited form of Void energy, which include Storm, Lunar, Darkness, and the four base elements of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air.
<h2>Asetian/Sethian Civilization</h2>
<p>Credit to: Samas for the information here:</p>
<p>The Asetian/Sethian civilization is sorted out into three groups which are known as the Concubines, Guardians, and Viperines. Each provide a certain function and all rely on one another which causes a stable support system. The Concubine are known to be more chaotic compared to the other groups. Unlike the other two groupings they can regenerate and purify their energy which allows the other two to be able “feed” off of them to amplify their abilities and attributes. The Guardians are known to be more grounded and energy sensitive compared to the other two groupings and can produce very strong defensive attributes such as shielding. The Viperine are known to be more aggressive and specialize in the more offensive attributes which can vary. Now since I named these three lineages everything about the Asetian Civilization will be easier to understand. All the Asetians are ruled over by the goddess Aset(Isis) while Sethians are ruled over by the God Set(Sutekh) They are the heads of their civilization and specifically has three kingdoms which organizes the lineages(groups). Each kingdom has a ruler and are typically known to be the “primordials” of their lineages and are directly connected to Aset and Set. The three kingdoms also have elders and keepers which are said to give advice to the rulers and to help keep the most sacred secrets of their lineage from the rest. They are basically the royal protectors of “society” The last position of authority in Asetian/Sethian society are the nobles. The nobles vary in number and it usually depends on the populous of the lineage/kingdom they reside in. The more cities a kingdom has, the more nobles they have. The nobles role in the ranking system is to mediate between the civilians and elders and to relay important information or issues going on in their kingdom.</p>
<h2>Becoming an Asetian/Sethian Vampire</h2>
<p>So this is pretty cut and dry, as in myth you hear that people can be turned vampires/daimons/asetians/sethians... this is very true, but not by what myth says. 
While Daimons is basically handing said curse to the one they have turned, Asetians/Sethians do something completely different which sadly I cannot share with you, as this remains a secret between Isis and her keepers and Elders as well as Set and his keepers and Elders and is not considered a curse but a gift to them. While if turned it will indeed work, what lineage the turnie becomes depends on said traits exhibited or the choice of the one doing the turning from what I have experienced.

<h2>Lineages</h2>
<h3>Concubines</h3>
<p>Concubines cores look almost like stone, concubines in particular have a hieroglyph of a scarab on their core, how they differ in terms of asetian and sethians is the energy the core gives off, while sethians energy is more chaotic aligned then their asetian cousins.</p>
<h3>Guardians</h3>
<p>Guardians core while also appearing stone-ish have the hieroglyph of a scorpion on their core.</p>
<h3>Viperine</h3>
<p>Viperine again like Concubine and Guardians they have a hieroglyph on their cores, but theirs in particular is that of a snake to represent their viperine lineage.</p>
<h2>Basic Concepts of the Asetian/Sethians</h2>
<h3>Concubines</h3>
<p>The Lineage of Concubines is the most chaotic from the three Lineages. Being so related to the concept of transformation and change (kheperu), they are likely to self-dissolve in their surroundings. Therefore, they have the inconvenient of having a weak personality, getting along with diverse opinions, sometimes incoherent, and being slightly vulnerable to manipulation. Due to this fact, they need to be accompanied by the right person, or they might loose themselves. When they are stable, due to their natural cycling (resulting in advanced sociability) they can have a great manipulative power on people and the "atmosphere" of a certain place. They also have a very energetic subtle body, which makes them great donors. Although, the Concubines seem to be the most stable, chaotic and less powerful of the three Lineages, all of these are equally important. Their power and stability depends on their accompaniment, self-development and nature.</p>

<p>"The Lineage of Concubines is known as the Scarab, a symbol of their highly transformative and adapting nature, along with their characteristically intense cycling and ability to share energy with a great ease."
<p>- Asetian Bible


<h3>Guardians</h3>
<p>Guardians, With an unquestionable and undeniable bond to Kemet, those who belong to the Guardian Lineage, are the descendants of the Primordial Scorpion, being the lineage with the most powerful feeling of loyalty engraved on their hearts. They are seen as important pillars among the lineages, also because their strong connection with the Earth, which gives them an inborn ability to develop remarkable energy shields, holding this great connection with the Earth, they possess the slowest energy metabolism of the three, allowing them to feed not so regularly as the other lineages. Guardians are anti-social and elitist beings by nature. They deeply condemn the lack of personality they observe in the humanity, which typically acts according to what common society expects of them. Also because of this, their relationships are extremely restricted.</p>

<p>"To many of the Guardians, love is the engine of life itself, the energy that sustains
<p>them and makes them move, adapt and evolve. Nothing makes sense without the presence 
<p>of that one true love, which they believe in, and all the motivations and actions of life itself 
<p>are kept to fulfill that one purpose –living with and for the loved one"
<p>- Asetian Bible

<h3>Viperines</h3>
<p>Viperines are the most predatory and energy-sensitive of the lineages, they are the ones with a most intimate connection with energy, the subtle and with highly evolved metaphysical abilities. Owners of dangerously powerful manipulative abilities, the Serpents are commonly one of the most feared beings among the lineages. But despite their aggressive nature, they are honorable leaders and guides, being the ones that the lineages commonly relies on for intuition and insight.</p>

<p>"The Lineage of Viperines is known as the Serpent, representing</p>
<p>the most predatory of all immortal bloodlines, a symbol of advanced
<p>metaphysical senses, capable of delivering unsuspected lethal attacks, being 
<p>the perfect archetype of eternal rebirth and transformation."
<p>- Asetian Bible

<h3>Keepers- Children of Anubis</h3>
<p>The Keepers are magickally aware creatures, deeply connected to Kemet (Ancient Egypt). They have a strong bond with the Asetians and Sethians, who they vigorously protect, spiritually and physically(guardians of sorts). This protecting task was appointed by their Father, Anubis, who learned his magic from Aset Herself and dedicated to the protection of the sethians and Asetians. Overtime ended up intertwined int the lineages family.</p>

<p>"While their awakening can refer to the discovery of their energy 
<p>and psychic abilities, the true awakening to a Keeper is when he finally 
<p>understands his importance and path along the Asetian tradition."
<p>- Asetian Bible
