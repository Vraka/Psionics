<h1>Kikiyaon</h1>
<div class="center box">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Kikiyaon are humanoid owl demons originating in West Africa. They are a tribal warrior race whose society revolves largely around strength. Oftentimes they are not only feared for their fighting ability, but for their abilities and barbaric practices.</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>While not the tallest of beings - reaching around 5 feet in height - the Kikiyaon still strike an imposing figure. While humanoid in stature, they are characterized by an owl head and wings, piercing red eyes, and long claws on their feet and hands. However, the most interesting aspect of their appearance is their feathers. When they are born, the Kikiyaon have pure white feathers. They do not stay this way for long, as their feathers absorb the blood of their fallen enemies. This is one way of determining the strength of a Kikiyaon on sight - by adolecence their plummage is usually some shade of red. As they fight more, their feathers grow darker; the most experienced Kikiyaon eventually turn black as the night.</p>
<h2>Lifestyle</h2>
<p>One of the most important aspects of Kikiyaon life is hunting. Generally hunting in packs, groups of Kikiyaon will leave the village to find food for the tribe. Once their claws get to an acceptable length, young Kikiyaon join an experienced hunting group for their first blood letting. A right of passage that every Kikiyaon goes through, the hunting party will subdue their prey and have the young addition finish it off, earning the first blood on their feathers.The Kikiyaon often have duels to determine who's the strongest amongst them, and therefore who should lead the tribe, as well as to settle disputes. Another status symbol is the house of a Kikiyaon, used as a way to show off their strength and kills. Each hut is built from the bones of their kills, so the more they kill, the larger their houses get.</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Even though they can fly, the Kikiyaon possess strong legs which, coupled with their lean body, allowing them to run at high speeds. Their most dangerous ability is their bite. They naturally inject corruptive energy into their bite, causing severe illness in the victim until their core is corrupted and they die. The time until death is dependent on the size, and EM ability of the target, and can be fought off like any other corruption. However, without proper treatment even a fully grown dragon succumbs within 24 hours of the bite.</p>
