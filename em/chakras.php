<h2>1st: The Root Chakra</h2>
<img src="../img/chakra-root.png" style="width:50%;height:auto;">
<p>The official name of this chakra is the Muladhara; this name comes from the words “mula” which names root and “dhara” which means support. This chakras role is connect your energy system with the earth, this is called <a href="grouding.php">grounding</a>.</p>
<p>Some consider this chakras role is also to give your everything you need to survive; for us in this modern age that would typically be financial and emotional security. This chakra is often shown as red and is located at the very base of your spine near your tail bone.</p>

<h3>When overactive:</h3>
<p>Our root chakra gets a lot of use; having an overactive root chakra if very common. An overactive root chakra will cause issues like anxiety and jitteriness; this happens due to fear being a base need to survive (fear's role is to keep us alive) and an over active root chakra will spam messages of survival even when no real threat is there; thus you will have anxiety problems. Physically you may get symptoms of digestive problems, lower back issues, hip pain, ovarian cysts in women or prostate issues in men.</p>

<h3>Balancing your root chakra:</h3>
<p>Its important to take care of your survival needs as this chakra gives you the energy to do that, so utilize the energy to the best of your ability. To calm this chakra focus on your connection to spirit, take time each day to nurture your soul by praying, meditating or connecting with spirit guides. Volunteering and random acts of kindness and compassion can guide overactive energy away from your root chakra and into other chakras in your body.</p>

<h3>When underactive:</h3>
<p>If your needs have been generally taken care of throughout your life, then this chakra may not be very active. If that’s the case you may experience frequent day dreaming, trouble concentrating or simple feeling like your “head’s in the clouds”. People may describe you as an “airhead” or “spacey”. These may not seem like major issues but being balanced and connected is important.</p>

<h3>To energize:</h3>
<p>You can re-energize your root chakra by reconnecting to the earth; by being out in nature. Gardening, swimming, or even playing in the leaves can energize your root chakra.</p>

<h2>2nd: The Sacral Chakra</h2>
<img src="../img/chakra-sacral.png" style="width:50%;height:auto;">

Symptoms include addiction, obesity, hormone imbalances and restlessness.</p>

<h3>Balancing your sacral chakra:</h3>
<p>Ask yourself “Is what I am about to do good for me? Is it healthy and nourishing? What are the benefits of the action I’m about to take?” Take time to assess whether your actions are healthy is a great way to draw energy away from this chakra and balance it out.</p>

<h2>3rd: The Solar Plexus Chakra</h2>
<img src="../img/chakra-solarplexus.png" style="width:50%;height:auto;">
<p>The official name of this chakra is the Manipura; this name translates to “lustrous gem”. This chakra is where your self-confidence, identity and personal power are born. Have you ever been in a situation that you just knew wasn’t right for you? </p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve been in a situation that you knew was going to work out. Where did you feel those cues in your body? Most people say that they get a “gut feeling” in reality this is the seat of your personal power, and you can physically feel that confidence and wisdom in its location. This chakra is often shown as yellow and is located in the center of the belly button.</p>

<h3>When balanced:</h3>
<p>You will feel a sense of wisdom, decisiveness and personal power. Many call this chakra the warrior chakra as the feeling you get from it is comparable to a wise warrior going into battle with the confidence to win and the wisdom to know the personal truth he is fighting for.</p>

You may suffer from digestive issues or even imbalances in your internal organs like the appendix, pancreas, liver and kidneys.</p>

<p>Think of the things that you know you’re good at; everyone has talents and abilities. Make a list of yours; feel how the confidence in those talents makes your stomach tingle and vibrate. Empower that feeling by creating your own personal affirmations.</p>

<h2>4th: The Heart Chakra</h2>
<img src="../img/chakra-heart.png" style="width:50%;height:auto;">
<p>The official name of this chakra is the Anahata; this name translates to “unhurt”. This chakra is where your love, compassion and kindness are empowered. It’s not hard to understand this chakra. We all associate our hearts with love and that’s exactly what this chakra is all about. This includes love for others and love for yourself, which is why this chakra is also associated with health and healing. This chakra is often shown as green and is located right over your heart.</p>

<h3>When balanced:</h3>
<p>You are able to equally feel love for yourself and others. Even though things happen, you can still see the compassion and kindness in others.</p>

<h3>When overactive:</h3>
<p>We lose personal boundaries and start to make unhealthy choices, all in the name of love. Its important to treat yourself with the same compassion and kindness that you give others, but when the heart chakra is overactive you may find yourself putting the needs of others before your own. Symptoms include a fast heart rate, palpitations, heart burn and interpersonal relationship issues.</p>

<h3>Balancing your heart chakra:</h3>
<p>Take that love you’ve given to others and focus some of it back onto yourself. You can do this by doing one thing everyday just for you. Take a relaxing bath, treat yourself to a massage, meditate on sending compassion to yourself, etc.</p>

<h3>When underactive:</h3>
<p>Many people have an underactive heart chakra as life can send us a lot of heartbreak as a way to teach us lessons about ourselves and the world around us. But it can be hard to not take the lessons personally. When your heart chakra is underactive you will feel like its hard to get really close to anyone; like building a wall around your heart and not letting anyone in. Physically you may feel out of touch with your body and suffer from circulation problems.</p>

<h3>To energize:</h3>
<p>Energizing your heart chakra may take a lot of work. Many of us have worked hard to build up our walls and defenses and it isn’t always easy to knock them down. It first begins by loving yourself. Show appreciation for yourself and give yourself the that you want others to give to you. Then spread that compassion to others.</p>

<h2>5th: The Throat Chakra</h2>
<img src="../img/chakra-throat.png" style="width:50%;height:auto;">
<p>The official name of this chakra is the Vishuddha; this name translates to “very pure”. This chakra gives your personal truths a voice. Where does your voice come from? What provides the energy for you to speak? Physically speaking the answer is our throat, but energetically it is the throat chakra. Resting right above the heart this chakra is connected to the compassion and love you have for yourself and others and lets you speak your truth with clarity. This chakra is often shown as blue and is located in right between your collar bone.</p>

<h3>When balanced:</h3>
<p>You will be able to clearly speak with love, kindness and truth. You will know exactly which words are appropriate for each situation. Speaking with a balanced throat chakra will enlighten and inspire those around you.</p>

<h3>When overactive:</h3>
<p>A lot of time has been spent trying to make your voice heard. If you’ve often felt ignored or invalidated when you express yourself, you may have tried to overcome this by giving yourself a louder voice. Those with an overactive throat chakra will often interrupt others, often be told they have a loud voice or “love to hear themselves talk”. Physically you may suffer from throat pain, frequent infections, cavities or mouth ulcers.</p>

<h3>Balancing your throat chakra:</h3>
<p>Balancing is as easy as thinking before you speak. Ask yourself “Is it true? Is it necessary? Is it kind?”</p>

<h3>When underactive:</h3>
<p>Sometimes, we have been ignored and invalidated so much we have the opposite reaction; we shut down and stop speaking our truths. If you have an underactive throat chakra you’ve likely been called shy or quiet; you may find yourself unable to express your emotions or struggling for works when you try to speak your truth. Symptoms often include digestive issues, because energy diverted away from the throat chakra often ends up being “swallowed” or sent down to the solar plexus chakra.</p>

<h3>To energize:</h3>
<p>Speak the truth; even if no one is around you; practice speaking and expressing your emotions and truths when your alone. Its very common to think that we should only speak when someone else is around to hear it, but if your trying to energize your throat chakra it doesn’t matter if what you say is heard by anyone but yourself.</p>

<h2>6th: The Third Eye Chakra</h2>
<img src="../img/chakra-thirdeye.png" style="width:50%;height:auto;">
<p>The official name of this chakra is the Ajna; this name translates to “beyond wisdom”. This chakra opens your mind to the information beyond the physical world. Extra sensory perception (ESP), intuition or psychic energy all comes from the third eye. It is also commonly used as the focal point for scanning. There is actually a small pinecone shaped gland in your brain that takes in light. This gland, the pineal gland, is responsible for helping you feel awake in the daytime and sleepy at night.</p>
<p>Long before brain imaging, ancient cultures knew this Third Eye existed, and they also realized that it receives information from sources outside the physical world. This chakra is often shown as indigo and is located between your eyebrows.</p>

<h3>When balanced:</h3>
<p>A balanced third eye is a beautiful thing, and it’s really what you are trying to achieve when you start on a path to spiritual development. When balanced, you will equally feel in turn with both the physical and spiritual worlds. You will receive psychic information as a frequently as you receive information through your physical senses, but it will not overwhelm you.</p>

<h3>When overactive:</h3>
<p>It's highly unlikely this chakra is overactive; most people are very in tune with our physical selves and find it difficult to receive information outside of it. IF you have an overactive third eye you likely spend most of your time engrossed in psychic activities like tarot, astrology and the paranormal. When your third eye chakra is overactive those activities become overwhelming and distract you from living a human experience.</p>

<h3>Balancing your third eye chakra:</h3>
<p>If you find yourself confused with psychic information, take some time to remind yourself that you are a creature on this Earth. Go to the beach and feel the sand between your toes. Dig in the dirt in your garden. Connect your body to the earth and repeat: “I am a human being”</p>

<h3>When underactive:</h3>
<p>Most people have an underactive third eye chakra. We live in a world that often invalidates intuitive development; because of this we close off our third eyes and ignore the psychic experiences. Doing so can cause us to feel disconnected from spiritual experiences. Physically, you may feel headaches or have problems with allergies and your sinuses.</p>

<h3>To energize:</h3>
<p>Energizing your third eye will take practice; you will need to devote some time to quiet solitary meditation. At first, get used to the feeling of focusing on signals outside of your physical body. Listen to your spirit and recognize how that feels. As you practice this, you’ll find it easier and easier to connect with the energy from your third eye. Always remember, it takes time and practice, but everyone can do it if they put in the effort.</p>

<h2>7th: The Crown Chakra</h2>
<img src="../img/chakra-crown.png" style="width:50%;height:auto;">
<p>The official name of this chakra is the Sahaswara; this name translates to “thousand petaled”. This chakra is pure consciousness energy. The crown chakra is one of those energies that’s hard to explain. You can think of it like magnetism. When you hold a piece of metal to a magnet, you can feel the energy and tension, but you can’t see it. Consciousness energy is everywhere and in everything; It connects us to the entire universe.</p>
<p>Our own personal consciousness is located in the crown chakra, but it’s really more like a seed of a universal energy than something personal or individual. It has also been described as the point that connects us to our origins. This chakra is often shown as violet or white and is located at the top of your head.</p>

<h3>When balanced:</h3>
<p>Achieving a balanced crown is the goal of every spiritual warrior, and its not easy to do. You can think of it like the Buddhist concept of achieving nirvana. Once you achieve it, you’re not really human anymore; you’ve conquered suffering and death. Of course it is the journey of attempting to achieve this balance that brings us happiness, good health and wisdom. Trying to balance your crown chakra will align and balance all your other chakras.</p>

<h3>When overactive:</h3>
<p>Its not possible to have an overactive crown chakra. Because it is the seat of universal energy it is innately infinite; In other words you can’t exist in the world and be overcome with consciousness energy. </p>

<h3>Balancing your crown chakra:</h3>
<p>Since no one has an overactive crown chakra, there’s no need to consider how to calm the energy down.</p>

<h3>When underactive:</h3>
<p>And underactive crown chakra means you’re human. It feels exactly like being human; some people may be closer to achieving it while others may be far away. In any case, practicing spiritual development and balancing your other chakras will bring you close to experiencing the consciousness in your crown chakra.</p>

<h3>To energize:</h3>
<p>Instead of trying to open and activate your crown chakra, focus on balancing the others. Meditate and connect with the spiritual world; balance those activities with living and enjoying your human experience. Think of it like trying to win an Olympic gold medal. You don’t just try to win the medal, you train your body and mind first; that’s the only way to achieve such a huge goal is to focus on small, attainable goals first. The same goes or trying to open your crown chakra; don’t just attempt it; focus on maintaining and balancing all the other energies in your body.</p>
