<h1>Energy System</h1>
<div class="center box">
<h2>What is an Energy System?</h2>
<p>An Energy System, commonly shortened to ES, is essentially the energy body that resides inside a person.</p>

<h2>What makes up an ES?</h2>
<p>A ES consists of Nadis (energy pathways) and Chakras. Chakras are formed by multiple Nadis overlapping creating a large energy point inside the body.</p>

<h2>What does an ES do?</h2>
<p>The ES helps absorb energy and convert energy making it fully useable to you. When absorbing there are multiple ways; common methods are absorbing the energy directly from an affinity source (for example, a being with solar will find absorbing energy from the sun very refreshing), corrupting or purging foreign or stagnated energy which can then be converted and used to replenish your own energy, or in some cases "energy vampirism" where one person links to another and directly absorbs that persons energy converting it into their own.</p>

<h2>Stagnation</h2>
<p>Overtime, energy that has remained in one place for too long can cause your energy system to stagnate which will spread throughout your energy system if not caught early enough. Stagnation will slow your energy flow and dull your senses. Any stagnation can easily be removed from your ES via grounding and cleansing, in serious cases a healer may be needed.</p>

<h2>Damage to your ES</h2>
<p>Damage to an ES is possible, most cases of damage to your ES involves being in a fight or spar; where another has used energetic attacks against you to directly strike at your energy body or when stagnation has become so serious it has started to break down your nadis/energy pathways or damage your chakras. This can be fixed by either healing your own damage or asking a healer for help.</p>

<h2>What are chakras?</h2>
<p>Chakras are energy points where multiple Nadis/energy pathways overlap and create energy centers (aka node, chakras, etc). In the normal human body there are 7 major chakras. However, when looking at a soul that isn’t human, there is a chance they may have more or less chakras, or a different lay out compared to this traditional system.</p>
<p>There are two types of chakras that can exist inside a person’s energy system - major chakras meaning the 7 basic chakras, and minor chakras which are smaller than and not as dominant as the Majors. An energy system can consist of both major and minor chakras however chakras cannot be created without high level energy surgery and/or experimentation on an energy system. I would advise against even attempting this. Even those with high levels experience and training can easily go wrong and heavily damage the persons energy system with severe consequences.</p>
<p>Each chakras energy does not differ from the next, rather they regulated the same energy as each other throughout the energy body. It can be considered a circulatory system for your energy. That said, each of the 7 basic/major chakras do correspond with different meanings, symbolism and attributes.</p>
<p>In a healthy person all chakras will provide a balanced flow of energy throughout the energy system. But if one or more chakras are too open or closed, flowing to fast or slow, have damage or are out of balance it can cause energetic and physical health to suffer.</p>
<p>By learning about Chakras, you can become more in tune with the natural energy flow of your system. You can learn to connect physical, emotional and spiritual imbalances with the chakras that correspond; which of course can then lead you to learning to balance out your own energy and keep your energy system in a much healthier condition.</p>
