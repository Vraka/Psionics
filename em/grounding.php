<h1>Grounding</h1>
<div class="center box">
<p>Grounding is simply the process of anchoring your being and your energetic body to the Earth. When you establish a connection to the Earth via grounding, you create an open channel for the energy to enter your body, fueling each cell that exists in both your physical and energetic bodies. This spiritual energy takes  various names across cultures, including Light, Love, Holy Spirit, Chi,  Fluid of Life, Ki, Free energy, Reiki energy and the Body Electric, to name a few.</p>
<p>Grounding provides an instant energetic and spiritual connection; it also provides you with a solid foundation, helping you to bend, not break, in gusty winds, and it nurtures a sort of security in feeling connected to Spirit. The energy accessed while grounding is a rich source of healing, regenerative energy.</p>
<p>You can ground in any position through chakras, or energy centers, in the area touching the ground; for standing this would be the souls of your feet, while sitting it would be the end of your tail bone. These roots absorb the life force energy and swiftly carry it into your being, where it then cycles through you and continue back out into the Earth.</p>
