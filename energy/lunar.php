<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Lunar element is tied into the power of the moon, and is considered the opposite of the Solar element.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>Lunar as a element is rarely used outside of healing; it has many cooling and calming effects and can sooth people. Lunar is also tied to the stars and many who have lunar can learn how to summon constellations and how to use the moons gravitational pull; example: Lunar has strong pulls over water elements and can be used quite offensively against those with water affinities; IF the person using lunar is stronger than the person using water.</p>
